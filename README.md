![Coverage](https://github.com/HuiyiGuo34/36650-Assignment2-4/blob/main/coverage.png)
I was having trouble running my Sonar Scanner on VS Code; however, when I ran it on mac terminal, it worked well. But the coverage showed 0% on Sonar Qube, and when I printed it out in VS Code using command "coverage report -m", it showed the coverage has 76%. I do not what caused this conficts, but I think this is another way to prove that my code has more than 50% coverage.
